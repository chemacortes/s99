#s99 -- *Improved* **Ninety-Nine Scala Problems**

Original page: http://aperiodic.net/phil/scala/s-99/

These are an adaptation of the Ninety-Nine Prolog Problems written by Werner Hett at the Berne University of Applied Sciences in Berne, Switzerland. I (Phil Gold) have altered them to be more amenable to programming in Scala.
